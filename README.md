# 9-Project-Yugioh_Spellcards

One simple version for the spellcards in Yugioh.
This time I used classes instead of normal functions to test the difference between them.

Edit a few weeks Later:
I understood realy well, that classes are kind of lacking for these kind of projects, well atleast till I learned that there is something called "staticmethod", which literally solves the Issue of me having no functions to use in a class.
